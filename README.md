# 📂 Multimodal_RAG_SupplementaryFiles_2025

This repository contains all supplementary materials for the research project:  
**"Multimodal RAG Application with AI Observability and Document Intelligence"**, including:
- 🖼️ Static and dynamic architecture diagrams
- 🎥 Demo video of the system
- 📄 Published IJIRT paper (2024)

## 📖 Project Summary

This project presents a dual-model GenAI framework combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **multimodal input handling** and **AI observability**. It supports text, image (OCR), PDF, and URL inputs, and integrates tools like **LangChain**, **CrewAI**, **Gemini API**, **Qdrant**, and **Arize Phoenix**.

Two models were developed:
- **Studently.ai** (private, Streamlit-based academic tool)
- **SASAi** (open-source, Vercel-based JavaScript deployment)
